Customized, daily updated, `fedora-toolbox` image with a few extras for dev work.

## What is this?

These toolbox images are customized how I want, and avoid the need to install and upgrade RPMs after createing a distrobox.

Based on [fedora-toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox/tree/main/images/fedora/) of appropriate fedora version.
